<h1>Home for Humans: Development</h1>
<p>Home for Humans has been in the making for <i>years</i>. It is <b>no where near being done</b>. Even though it is a collective effort from <b>Psy·che·del·ic Studios</b>, it doesn't mean that multiple people are working on it. I am the only developer working on this game at the moment, even though I can't take all of the credit:

<h3>BlupHox (Dan)</h3> for being a great friend and fellow developer.

<h3>Joe</h3> for being a great friend and supporter. Also made some animations.

<h3>Toby Fox</h3> for creating Undertale and being a huge inspiration.
